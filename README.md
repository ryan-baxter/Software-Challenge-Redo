# Software Challenge (Redo)

Enclosed in this repository is an application that can be used to calculate the area and volume of a room, taking into account any window and door fixtures within the room, and how much paint will be needed in order to paint the room. This is a redo of my previous attempt called, "Room-Calculator".

## Getting Started

The next few sections will go over the instructions on how to get the application up and running on your machine for development/testing purposes. See the 'Deployment' section for information on how to deploy and run the application.

### Prerequisites

In order to get the application working, you will need to install Visual Studio on your machine. This section will cover how to install this software on your machine.

#### Step 1
```
Go to the Visual Studio webpage and
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
