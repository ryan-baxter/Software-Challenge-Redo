# Software Challenge (Redo)

Enclosed in this repository is an application that can be used to calculate the area and volume of a room, taking into account any window and door fixtures within the room, and how much paint will be needed in order to paint the room. This is a redo of my previous attempt called, "Room-Calculator".

## Getting Started

The next few sections will go over the instructions on how to get the application up and running on your machine for development/testing purposes. See the 'Deployment' section for information on how to deploy and run the application.

### Prerequisites

In order to get the application working, you will need to install Visual Studio on your machine. This section will cover how to install this software on your machine. If you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you can skip this section of the file. Use the link provided under the 'Built With' section to get to the Visual Studio website.

#### Step 1
Use the link provided above to open the Visual Studio website and download the Visual Studio IDE. When you hover over the 'Download Visual Studio' button, download the 'Community 2019' version of Visual Studio.

#### Step 2
Once the executable file has downloaded, run the file and follow the instructions in order to install Visual Studio on your machine.

#### Step 3
After the installation process, you will be presented with a selection of 'Web & Cloud' and 'Windows' workloads. Select the option entitled, ".NET desktop development" and click 'Install'.

Once Visual Studio Community 2019 has installed on your machine, you will be able to open and run the application.
### Installing

This section will cover a step by step process on how to install the software application on your machine and get it up and running.

#### Step 1
On the repository page for the software application, click on the 'Clone or download' button in the top right, then click on 'Download ZIP'. The application will be downloaded as a .zip file to your machine.

#### Step 2
Extract the application folder from the ZIP file and save it anywhere to your machine. Once extracted, open the folder and access the solution file, called 'RoomRedo.sln'. The application will now open up in Visual Studio.

In Visual Studio, click the 'Start' button in the navigation bar at the top of the screen to run the application.

## Deployment

Once the application is up and running, you will be presented with a window form entitled, "Add Room Measurements". On this form, you will be able to add the length, width, and height of the room you are calculating, as well as the measurements you used (either Feet or Metres) to measure the room.
